"Research Associate, Aquaculture Social Scientist","ECS is seeking a Research Associate, Aquaculture Social Scientist to work in our Juneau, AK.  Office .

 Job Description: 

Background:

Executive Order 13921, Promoting American Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth (EO, May 7, 2020) directs NOAA to identify Aquaculture Opportunity Areas (AOA) to plan for sustainable aquaculture development. The EO requires NOAA to complete a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for each AOA. In some instances, NOAA will also be responsible for completing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for individual projects requiring permits in federal waters.These documents include the need to assess the social impact of siting and operation of aquaculture facilities.

The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) Policy Directive 01-120, commits NOAA to Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM).The policy defines EBFM as “a systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specific area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals.”This policy also provides the framework for development of AOA’s and aquaculture in general, under existing laws.

Public perceptions about food production systems and consumer choices are largely about values.Therefore, successfully implementing the Executive Order (EO) to increase domestic aquaculture production and consumption will require attention to social license and developing metrics to evaluate options created by the identification of AOAs. Social license exists when a project or industry has ongoing support within the local community and other stakeholders, or broad social acceptance.

Detailed Description:

ECS seeks to hire a research associate in support of NOAA Fisheries to conduct social impact analyses focused on aquaculture to objectively and robustly evaluate social trade-offs and potential issues in the context of AOA identification and NEPA.This is necessary in order to “optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals” as is the goal for Ecosystem Based Management.

A social scientist will contribute to key aspects of the EO, by (1) informing the identification of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas, (2) supporting implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and (3) analyzing public perceptions to inform education, outreach, and ecosystem-based management of aquaculture.A key requirement of NEPA and the ecosystem approach is to articulate social, economic and environmental trade-offs, using consistent objective metrics.

The Research Associate shall:

Work as a social scientist on a larger team, develop and apply tools to measure and evaluate social impacts of aquaculture at national- and regional-scales that align and build upon NMFS’ work with capture fisheries and resource conservation, but also takes into account the unique social license issues with marine aquaculture.

Develop social impact tools to consistently apply social trade-off analysis and identify best solution scenarios that can be applied to identification of AOA’s in Alaska over the next 5 years.

Collaborate with NOAA's Office of Aquaculture, NCCOS and Regional Aquaculture Coordinators on opportunities to link social science and siting analysis tools (e.g., regional prioritization for Aquaculture Opportunity Areas based on social impact indicators).

Identify, develop, and apply social impact and trade-off analyses to NEPA processes as needed, including an assessment of environmental justice impacts and opportunities to link AOA development in Alaska with broader NOAA diversity and inclusion objectives. Apply best practices and tools to promote a more effective, efficient, and consistent consideration of environmental justice during NEPA reviews (e.g., Promising Practices for Environmental Justice Methodologies in NEPA Reviews; and EJScreen, Environmental Justice screening and mapping tool).

Collaborate with NOAA’s Office of Aquaculture and Regional Aquaculture Coordinator on operationalizing social science to improve ecosystem-based management of aquaculture, and strategies for gaining social license (e.g. information inoculation). This includes applying findings of national- and regional-level analyses to inform development of tailored outreach and communications plans.

Advise NOAA’s Office of Aquaculture about ongoing data collection needs for AOA management and aquaculture siting into the future.

Deliverables:

 Development of science advice and tools to consistently apply social impact analysis and trade-off analysis for aquaculture development to include Alaska AOA identification, commercial projects, and pilot-scale projects.  Development of a guidance document/protocols for conducting social impact analysis for identifying Alaska AOAs including data sources, methodologies, and lessons learned.  Detailed reports providing an analysis of social issues and impacts related to Alaska AOAs. 

Location/Note:

On-site location at the NOAA Fisheries Alaska Regional Office (709 W. 9th Street, Juneau AK. 99802) is preferred. Telework 3-4 days per week may be considered.

 Required Skills: 

 Knowledge and experience in social impact assessment in applied aquaculture, fisheries, natural resources, agriculture or related fields.  Knowledge and experience in trade-off analysis in applied aquaculture, fisheries, natural resources, agriculture, or related fields.  Experience in quantitative computational methods using various sources of data.  Experience in qualitative social science research methods, including the ability to develop, administer, and analyze data collection instruments such as surveys, interviews, and workshops.  Experience with modeling perceptions and tolerance of potential risk/negative impacts of different forms of aquaculture.  Experience applying research findings to inform public communications and outreach.  Familiarity with NEPA.  Attention to detail, and timely execution of work deliverables.  Knowledge of or experience in Alaska coastal communities.  Public trust security clearance.  U.S. Citizenship is required per contract. 

 Desired Skills: 

 Advanced degree in Social Science (PhD preferred).

A social scientist will contribute to key aspects of the EO, by (1) informing the identification of Aquaculture Opportunity Areas, (2) supporting implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and (3) analyzing public perceptions to inform education, outreach, and ecosystem-based management of aquaculture.A key requirement of NEPA and the ecosystem approach is to articulate social, economic and environmental trade-offs, using consistent objective metrics.

The Research Associate shall:

Work as a social scientist on a larger team, develop and apply tools to measure and evaluate social impacts of aquaculture at national- and regional-scales that align and build upon NMFS’ work with capture fisheries and resource conservation, but also takes into account the unique social license issues with marine aquaculture.

Develop social impact tools to consistently apply social trade-off analysis and identify best solution scenarios that can be applied to identification of AOA’s in Alaska over the next 5 years.

Collaborate with NOAA's Office of Aquaculture, NCCOS and Regional Aquaculture Coordinators on opportunities to link social science and siting analysis tools (e.g., regional prioritization for Aquaculture Opportunity Areas based on social impact indicators).

Identify, develop, and apply social impact and trade-off analyses to NEPA processes as needed, including an assessment of environmental justice impacts and opportunities to link AOA development in Alaska with broader NOAA diversity and inclusion objectives. Apply best practices and tools to promote a more effective, efficient, and consistent consideration of environmental justice during NEPA reviews (e.g., Promising Practices for Environmental Justice Methodologies in NEPA Reviews; and EJScreen, Environmental Justice screening and mapping tool).

Collaborate with NOAA’s Office of Aquaculture and Regional Aquaculture Coordinator on operationalizing social science to improve ecosystem-based management of aquaculture, and strategies for gaining social license (e.g. information inoculation). This includes applying findings of national- and regional-level analyses to inform development of tailored outreach and communications plans.

Advise NOAA’s Office of Aquaculture about ongoing data collection needs for AOA management and aquaculture siting into the future.

Deliverables:

<ul><li> Development of science advice and tools to consistently apply social impact analysis and trade-off analysis for aquaculture development to include Alaska AOA identification, commercial projects, and pilot-scale projects. </li><li> Development of a guidance document/protocols for conducting social impact analysis for identifying Alaska AOAs including data sources, methodologies, and lessons learned. </li><li> Detailed reports providing an analysis of social issues and impacts related to Alaska AOAs. 

</li></ul>Location/Note:
