Job Description

The Data, Analysis, and Visualization group and the AI, Learning and Intelligent Systems group, located within NREL’s Computational Sciences Center, are seeking a full-time researcher specializing in the combined field of AI/ML and visualization. The researcher should be dynamic, motivated, and have a strong interest in advancing the renewable energy mission of NREL by delivering world class research, innovation, and leadership in computational science.

This position will work in the intersection of visualization and artificial intelligence, pushing the state of the art in both disciplines through fundamental developments as well as applications related to renewable energy and energy efficiency. The successful candidate will contribute to existing projects and will be expected to help NREL grow new research by leading proposals and projects, mentoring students and junior staff and contributing to the strategic growth of the computational science center.

Candidates with prior experience in fundamental AI and Vis research including explainable AI, trustworthy AI, the visualization of high-dimensional data, uncertainty, time-series, and decision-making will find great opportunity to apply their skills in this position.

Candidates should have a strong technical background, work ethic, and be comfortable learning and applying new technologies, as the role will include self-starting, keeping pace with state-of-the-art research and development, and performing technical tasks independently. However, the role will also require collaboration and effective communication with peers, mentors, and team members, as well as with stakeholders outside of the team with a high degree of professionalism. The successful candidate will not shy away from tackling challenges, but rather, demonstrate eagerness to devise new creative solutions grounded in current state-of-the-art. In this vein, the candidate should have a high degree of curiosity, excitement to work as part of a diverse team, and the ability to adapt to needs of differing projects and challenges by gaining and utilizing new skills in support of research goals.

Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

Compensation and Benefits*

Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:

 Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.  Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.  401(k) plan with 4% matching.  22 weeks of paid parental leave.  Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.  Fertility benefits via Carrot.  Daily lunches and snacks in our office.  Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area. 

UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees:

 Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.  Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.  Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary).  22 weeks of paid parental leave.  Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more! Health cash plan.  Life insurance and income protection.  Daily lunches and snacks in our office.  This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial. 

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research . This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3 , Circuit-Based Interpretability , Multimodal Neurons , Scaling Laws , AI & Compute , Concrete Problems in AI Safety , and Learning from Human Preferences .
