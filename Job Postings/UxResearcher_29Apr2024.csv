Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

"Senior UX Researcher","Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging. Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of the world through the power of writing.
At Medium you have the chance to dig deep into questions that will impact how we build a better product for the millions of people who find wisdom, community, and take part in thoughtful discussions on Medium.
We’d love to hear more about your experiences as a researcher working with product teams and equipping them with insights to make better decisions. How has your research informed product roadmaps? What sorts of findings have enabled designers to make better choices, or explore different paths? Your depth of experiences, hunger to develop skills in others, and drive towards defining and achieving successful outcomes will be your superpowers.

In this role you will be able to leverage both your knowledge of research operations, and your experience as a practitioner, and will bring both of those unique perspectives to strategic discussions.
You will help shape the foundation of research at Medium as our team evolves over time. You will execute studies across a variety of methodologies as well provide mentorship and direction to other UX Researchers. You will help teams develop strategic research plans to help answer the most pressing questions our product and content teams are trying to answer. You will often partner with our Data Science team to ensure that discussions carry the clearest picture that we can paint of who we are building for, and what problems we are trying to solve.

"UX Researcher, Checkout Experience","Who we are

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

The UX Research team is part of Stripe’s Design team and works across many types of brand and product initiatives at Stripe to more effectively and efficiently deliver products and experiences that fulfill user needs. And since Stripe’s main audience is other people who build products, we agonize over and take pride in crafting user-friendly and user-focused experiences.

In addition to conducting primary research, we also enable other Stripes (engineers, product managers, designers, marketers, sales, operations, etc.) to learn and apply research skills to global problems. You will play a role in shaping how we build research as a core competency across Stripe and define how we put users first when conducting research.

What you’ll do

As a UX Researcher, you will be dedicated to the Checkout Experience team and collaborate directly with product, engineering, sales, marketing and design teams. This is a full-time role based in Canada or the United States. This would be an excellent opportunity for a mixed methods researcher who is interested in building and applying their craft to develop experiences for the Checkout Experience team which focuses on subscriptions, invoices, tax, reporting and revenue recognition products.

Responsibilities

Lead critical research efforts that deepen our understanding of the user experience and drive product strategyWork in a highly collaborative fashion as a strategic partner to product managers, designers, and engineers to define both the long-term strategy and the short-term tactics for our products by grounding these decisions in user needs and insightsPrioritize research needs and approaches across multiple work streams to work on the right project, scale, and scope at the right time and ensure impact by delivering actionable insightsEnable other Stripes to learn and apply research skills by building research programs, platforms, and toolkits that empower them to conduct tactical researchPartner closely with other researchers to build out Stripe’s research practice and infrastructureDisseminate research insights to evolve and enhance Stripe’s understanding of user needs and identify innovative opportunities to meet those needs


Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements

Has 3+ years relevant user research experience at a tech, product-driven company working on digital experiences You are a mixed-methods researcher, with strength in qualitative research generating actionable insights that drive impactHas experience conducting complex research at scale and demonstrate the use of a variety of research methods, which may include qualitative interviews, surveys, ideation sessions, ethnographic field research, usability evaluation, and diary studies


Preferred Qualifications

Can lead, design, execute, and communicate impactful research in a fast-paced, earlier stage product development process and know how to integrate research into product and design roadmapsAbility to tell compelling stories and are skilled in explaining your work, process, and decisions to cross-functional stakeholders and crave feedback to help you produce your best work.Relentlessly focus on users and solving for their needs and wants. You put users first and have experience driving impact from insightsCan successfully set and achieve priorities that find the perfect balance between benefiting the project, the Research team, and all of StripeCan balance working with urgency and focus with methodological rigor and adapt as needed for the situation


Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $128,200 - $192,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","Who we are
