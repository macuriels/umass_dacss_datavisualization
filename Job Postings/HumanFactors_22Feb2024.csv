To Be Successful In This Role, You'll Be

","We all depend on healthcare throughout our lifetimes, for ourselves, and our families and friends, but it is notoriously difficult to navigate and understand. As an industry that comprises 20% of the US economy we think healthcare should work better for all of us. At Collective Health we believe it’s time for a new day in healthcare where as members we are informed and empowered to make the right care choices when the decisions are urgent and critical.

"User Experience Research Senior Manager (Human Factors)","The Company

Are you looking to join an organization that is growing and dynamic? What about a high-energy, collaborative environment that rewards hard work?

J.S. Held is a global consulting firm that combines technical, scientific, financial, and strategic expertise to advise clients seeking to realize value and mitigate risk. Our professionals serve as trusted advisors to organizations facing high stakes matters demanding urgent attention, staunch integrity, proven experience, clear-cut analysis, and an understanding of both tangible and intangible assets.

The firm provides a comprehensive suite of services, products, and data that enable clients to navigate complex, contentious, and often catastrophic situations.

The Team And Job Summary

We are seeking a highly experienced User Experience Research Senior Manager to join our Human Factors team. This is a unique opportunity for an entrepreneurial, highly driven person with a well-rounded skill set to join the Human Factors team, whose responsibilities extend beyond those of traditional Human Factors professionals. The ideal person for this role will need to have not only strong quantitative and qualitative UX research skills and experience, but also be flexible and a strategic thinker, able to hire and mentor junior staff, significantly contribute to the team’s strategy for growth, have a proven track record of developing a very substantial volume of business, and perform research as an individual contributor on a number of concurrent projects. This role represents a significant departure from the typical UX manager role, in its very prominent emphasis on business development and reduced emphasis on people and project management.

The Human Factors team performs a variety of studies related to product use-related health, safety, usability, and user experience, by bringing to bear methodologies from basic science, such as eye tracking, physiological data recording, or motion capture. You will make very substantial contributions to the marketing and selling of the team’s UX research projects, scoping and budgeting such projects, writing the corresponding client proposals, operationalizing client needs as empirical research questions, designing bespoke studies around those research questions, collecting data from participants using a wealth of custom-tailored methodologies, analyzing data in creative ways, and translating the results back into actionable outcomes for our clients. You will also help grow and mentor the team and contribute to its strategic initiatives. Because of the centrality of successful human-machine interaction to the safety of users and other stakeholders, your work may also entail working up litigation matters related to alleged product defects and, eventually, testifying as an expert witness. As a consultant, your experiences will be as varied and diverse as the products and services out there, possibly spanning automotive, medical, pharma, consumer electronics, appliances, heavy machinery, child products, and extended reality products – although the exact nature of your work will be determined by your ability to generate work in various industries.

Please submit an academic CV in addition to a more traditional resume.

Job Responsibilities

 This role will entail very significant levels of marketing and business development. It will further entail the hiring and mentoring of junior staff. It will also involve study design, execution, data analysis, and report preparation. It will require managing multiple concurrent projects.  You may also eventually serve as a testifying expert in litigation. A successful candidate is one who has tenacity, endurance, perseverance, and determination, as well as creativity, ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, and who exhibits a high degree of autonomy, ownership, business sense, and the ability to think strategically.

Required Qualifications

Ph.D. in Experimental, Developmental, Perceptual, or Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Science, or a related basic scientific psychology field preferred. A minimum of seven to ten years of experience in industry. Alternatively, Master’s Degree in Experimental, Developmental, Perceptual, or Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Science, or Human Factors, plus minimum of ten to fifteen years experience in industry. Excellent oral and written communication skills. Entrepreneurial drive and passion to succeed. Proven track record of ownership of empirical research (both quantitative and qualitative), from study inception to study design and execution to data analysis and interpretation. Excellent inferential statistics and data analytic skills. Possible interest in potential litigation support and/or forensic work.

Physical And Mental Job Qualifications

 Ability to travel as needed, depending on project assignments. Prolonged periods of sitting at a desk and working on a computer.

J.S. Held is a global consulting firm that combines technical, scientific, financial, and strategic expertise to advise clients seeking to realize value and mitigate risk. Our professionals serve as trusted advisors to organizations facing high stakes matters demanding urgent attention, staunch integrity, proven experience, clear-cut analysis, and an understanding of both tangible and intangible assets.

The firm provides a comprehensive suite of services, products, and data that enable clients to navigate complex, contentious, and often catastrophic situations.

<strong>The Team And Job Summary

</strong>We are seeking a highly experienced User Experience Research Senior Manager to join our Human Factors team. This is a unique opportunity for an entrepreneurial, highly driven person with a well-rounded skill set to join the Human Factors team, whose responsibilities extend beyond those of traditional Human Factors professionals. The ideal person for this role will need to have not only strong quantitative and qualitative UX research skills and experience, but also be flexible and a strategic thinker, able to hire and mentor junior staff, significantly contribute to the team’s strategy for growth, have a proven track record of developing a very substantial volume of business, and perform research as an individual contributor on a number of concurrent projects. This role represents a significant departure from the typical UX manager role, in its very prominent emphasis on business development and reduced emphasis on people and project management.

The Human Factors team performs a variety of studies related to product use-related health, safety, usability, and user experience, by bringing to bear methodologies from basic science, such as eye tracking, physiological data recording, or motion capture. You will make very substantial contributions to the marketing and selling of the team’s UX research projects, scoping and budgeting such projects, writing the corresponding client proposals, operationalizing client needs as empirical research questions, designing bespoke studies around those research questions, collecting data from participants using a wealth of custom-tailored methodologies, analyzing data in creative ways, and translating the results back into actionable outcomes for our clients. You will also help grow and mentor the team and contribute to its strategic initiatives. Because of the centrality of successful human-machine interaction to the safety of users and other stakeholders, your work may also entail working up litigation matters related to alleged product defects and, eventually, testifying as an expert witness. As a consultant, your experiences will be as varied and diverse as the products and services out there, possibly spanning automotive, medical, pharma, consumer electronics, appliances, heavy machinery, child products, and extended reality products – although the exact nature of your work will be determined by your ability to generate work in various industries.

Please submit an academic CV in addition to a more traditional resume.
