</strong>At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: ""Focus on the user and all else will follow."" Quantitative User Experience Researchers make this possible.

Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, needs, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.

As a Quantitative User Experience Researcher (Quant UXR), you’ll help inform your team of UXers, product managers, and engineers about user needs. You’ll play a critical role in creating useful, usable, and delightful products. You’ll work with stakeholders across functions and levels and have impact at all stages of product development.

You will investigate user behavior and user needs using empirical research methods such as logs analysis, survey research, path modeling, and regression analysis. Quant UXRs vary in background and use skills from computer science, quantitative social science, econometrics, data science, survey research, psychology, human-computer interaction, and other fields. You’ll combine skills in behavioral research design, statistical methods, and general programming to improve user experience.

The Quantitative UXR community at Google will help you do your best work. You’ll have the opportunity to work with and learn from UXRs across Google through regular meetups, mentor programs, and access to internal research tools.

User experience is at the forefront of how we create intuitive, innovative, and beautiful products that people love. We strive to learn and understand our users’ needs, behaviors, and emotions to gather insights that inform product strategy and design. Our UX teams include designers, researchers, content strategists, and engineers who are passionate about quality, usability, and simplicity. We work on collaborative teams to solve complex challenges and craft experiences that highlight our products’ unique capabilities and personalities. Our work touches billions while exemplifying a key principle that is core to Google’s philosophy: “Focus on the user and all else will follow.”
