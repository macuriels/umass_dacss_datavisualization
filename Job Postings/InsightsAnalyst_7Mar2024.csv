Our clients are generally large and mid-size organizations in the retail, technology, healthcare, and utility industries.

"Senior Quantitative User Experience Researcher","About The Role

We’re looking for someone who’s excited to play an intimate and critical role in shaping the direction of Inflection, focusing on understanding how people use and get value from Pi. This position is hands-on and offers significant partnership with leadership. From market discovery research to rigorous survey work focused on understanding our current users and the category at large, you’ll execute research closely with Product, Design, Data Science, Marketing and Eng that leads to actionable strategies. You’ll be part of the end-to-end journey of how we solve “personal AI” for everyone.

You are:

Humble, hungry, and driven by the work. A passionate individual contributor who thrives on collaboration. A research expert - you have a strong command of mixed methods, but with a strong quantitative lean. 

In the role, you’ll:

Be a strategic peer in making business-level decisions. Partner with our first researcher to set the vision for how research impacts and influences all corners of the Inflection team’s ways of working and our product, Pi. Develop and run recurring tracking surveys to support both foundational user understanding, marketing, product, and even our LLM teams. This will include brand and category tracking surveys, as well as current user satisfaction surveys. All of this will be done with creativity to maximize the ways survey work can impact as many Inflection teams as possible. Develop and run ad-hoc, foundational surveys to understand all manners of foundational questions about our current user and non-user communities to illuminate key, strategic user needs and untapped market opportunities. This work will range in impact from grounding our team in what we know about our users to prioritizing what we build next. Partner with our research team to create a unified body of foundational insights, working across all manners of qualitative and quantitative data sources (surveys, log data, etc). Influence how we surface insights from existing user data, particularly in rich, nuanced conversations of users and AI, and build out the process for doing so. This involves collaboration with data engineering, log teams, data science and more. You’ll flex. Though this role seeks a quantitative subject matter expert, the team is small and at times, you’ll step in to support qualitative research work like usability tests, discovery research, and other evaluation methods to either guide active product initiatives or influence future ones. You know how to do this with hustle, or at scale depending on need. Collaborate closely with product, designers, and engineers to integrate research insights into product strategy, marketing, and roadmaps. Present and evangelize research findings to internal teams and stakeholders in an engaging, focused, and actionable manner. 

Qualifications

Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Statistics, Cognitive Science, or related field. Equivalent experience is also acceptable. 6+ years of experience in user research. Experience in early-stage or nimble consumer-facing tech companies. Expertise in quantitative methods including survey research (sampling, design, analysis), segmentation, brand tracking, concept testing. Proficient in qualitative methods like usability testing, 1-1 interviewing, etc. Strong experience in statistical analysis (R, SPSS) and proficiency in SQL. Exceptional communication skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to articulate complex concepts clearly and effectively.
