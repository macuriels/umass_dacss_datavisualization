The Company

Propeller is a people-focused management consulting firm that helps individuals, teams, and organizations thrive in change. Organizations hire us to solve problems, inspire transformation, and drive change. We work with clients to align teams and priorities, clear hurdles, and deliver customized solutions. And in doing so, Propeller helps spark, regain, and accelerate the most impactful and energizing force we know: momentum.

Our clients are generally large and mid-size organizations in the retail, technology, healthcare, and utility industries. These organizations are where we drive the most impact, but we serve all different types of clients. We have offices in Portland, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Denver - and are growing into Dallas and Minneapolis.

Propeller may be for you if you have an unyielding passion for unraveling complex challenges, delivering creative, impact-driven solutions, and creating lasting progress. You are curious, you thrive in the unknown, and you have the grit to continue moving projects forward while guiding leaders and teams through ambiguous challenges.

The Specifics

Compensation: We believe in fairly and equitably compensating our employees for their time and experience. We do that by offering a competitive salary, uncapped bonus eligibility, an employee stock ownership program, and many other benefits. Individual salaries are based on a variety of factors, including years of experience, specific skill sets, and anticipated marketability to Propeller clients. The base compensation range for this position is $125,000 to $140,000 plus a 5% - 10% bonus target, which is specific to the location for this job posting. Typically, individuals are not hired at the top of the range for their role; however, base pay ranges are reviewed and updated each year based on performance.

Location: Propeller is a local-for-local consulting firm. We believe being physically present with each other and our clients strengthens our relationships, promotes creativity and innovation, and ultimately produces a stronger, more durable result for our clients and ourselves. Propeller consultants typically work in a hybrid model, spending a portion of their week working from their client site, local Propeller office, and home. In some cases, consultants work full time at their client sites. Exact schedules vary by client engagement. Applicants should currently live in the Denver area, or plan to relocate upon hire.

We strive to keep consultants rooted in their local community, minimizing out-of-market travel. This is balanced with an all-firm staffing model and a desire to accommodate growing client demand for in-person work. While some travel may be necessary, it is capped at 25% for this role. We prioritize a tailored approach to travel, taking into consideration individual preferences in project assignments.

Hiring Timeline: The typical hiring process spans 4 interviews across 4 - 6 weeks, but our clients' needs influence our hiring practices. As a result, the timeline for this position is variable and we may expedite or extend the hiring process based on client demand. We value transparency and are committed to keeping you updated on the progress of your application. If there are any updates on the timeline for this role, we will communicate them to you promptly.

Propeller is an Equal Opportunity Employer (EOE). We are committed to attracting, developing, and advancing the most talented individuals regardless of their race, sexual orientation, religion, age, gender, disability status or any other dimension of diversity.

Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.

Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.
