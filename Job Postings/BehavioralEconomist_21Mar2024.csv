Environmental economist Volunteer Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention

http //preventwildfire.world/

The earth is burning; e.g., USA/California, Brazil, Australia. Regional impacts of wildfires are widespread affecting health, housing, agriculture, biodiversity, and economies. Our post hoc ""pay for damage done"" insurance strategies are woefully inadequate for these rising challenges.

We need to seize the opportunity that is now possible. We think the science has gotten better, and a new inflection point is possible. If we leverage a broader diversity of disciplines with increasing bearing on the intractable challenge of catastrophic wildfire prevention, we can reclaim collective agency. We think that could be possible via increased design science for prevention, mitigation and loss reduction at the landscape and community level.

We plan to develop a year-round alliance of ecosystem partners that can help us transformationally scale catastrophic wildfire risk prevention through better understanding of the opportunities for ""action"" that is preventative and the costs of inaction that these mitigation steps will avoid. We believe that systemic change in wildfire risk reduction is possible and want to speak about the possibility of strategic collaboration to shift the practice of stakeholders at risk so that California does not become increasingly unliveable every year. We believe catastrophic wildfire risk prevention can help us get ahead of the curve counteracting these harms.

CrowdDoing is launching a year-round virtual Global Alliance for Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention with shared values and an open invitation for participation.

Global Alliance for Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention

Shared Principles

More reuse of global knowledge regarding how to prevent catastrophic wildfires is necessary.We need greater leveraging of knowledge from across disciplines in order to prevent the growing risk of catastrophic wildfires due to climate change.We need greater collaboration both locally and globally to achieve the community level goal of regeneration and reduced catastrophic wildfire risk.There is interdependence across the ecosystem of approaches and interventions for preventing catastrophic wildfires.The more upstream we can intervene effectively to prevent catastrophic wildfires, the more co-benefits for stakeholders we can create
