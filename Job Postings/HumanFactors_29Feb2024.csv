 Additional Skills & Qualifications 

Need to have worked on behavioral research in some sort of way so not strictly surveys or qualitative questionnaires- thinking about how to measure peoples responses (or measuring action)

Either behavioral observation or measuring behavior like reaching or walking or some sort of action response

Vision science perception and action, some psychology or biomechanics, bioengineering

A lot of it is working with software product teams to figure out what their needs and research support needs are. Translating research findings into recommendations or mitigation strategies. How to make something better or safer. A lot of the role is not running the study or recruiting participants but higher research scientist level bringing subject matter expertise to figure out if you need to run a study or if previous experience that would help with those question

Generally we are research partners with various product teams- the questions we are asking and answering tend to be around user safety predominately rather than usability or user experience.

Day to day responsibilities would include attending certain product meetings with various product teams that would be a mix of research PM, eng, drafting out research briefs. Creation of research studies to answer questions. Coordinating with a vendor for that research to happen and then translating insights from vendor findings into actionable product insights.

Human movement or modeling data visualization that would be good

Not working with participants - the likelihood of them running the study

High focus on people's ability to visualize data and interpret data and have product sense

Create the protocol but less so having to run studies
