Data Science @ Pave

Data is truly at the heart of what we do here at Pave. So, it’s no surprise that Pave Data Scientists are integral collaborators and strategic owners with company-wide impact. Our team members build data infrastructure, create and deploy ML models, define and evaluate metrics, and help create the tools our customers use to understand our unique data set.

How you'll contribute: 

We’re looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our Market Data Team. The Market Data Teams prototypes and builds brand new data products, as well as leveraging data to improve our existing ones.

Our Compensation Philosophy

Pave’s compensation philosophy is to target the 75th percentile of the market for both cash and equity at your job level. This means that the “mid point” of every band at Pave is the 75th percentile of the broader market.

Pave also has a merit-based philosophy when it comes to compensation increases. We run a performance cycle twice per year to evaluate employees’ performance. Higher than average performance ratings result in compensation increases to the upper end of the individual’s compensation range for their role. The result is that high performers at Pave are paid above the 75th percentile of the market at large.

Pave is committed to pay equity. If you get an offer from Pave, it will be based on your level as determined by your interview performance. And nothing else. We explicitly do not negotiate salary and equity to ensure that we aren’t introducing bias that could lead to pay inequities within the team between candidates who have different negotiation tactics.
