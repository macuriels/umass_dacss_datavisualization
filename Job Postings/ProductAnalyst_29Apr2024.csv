About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses.

What you’ll do

As a member of the User Risk Strategy team, you will partner with cross-functional teams—including Risk, Product, Partnerships, Legal, Sales, and Data Science—to design and execute on strategies and projects to improve Stripe’s risk controls and user experience.

Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $91,600 - $177,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","Who we are

<strong>About Stripe

That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

<strong>About The Team

The User Risk Strategy protects and advances Stripe’s business, brand, and mission by building and deploying industry-leading policies and practices that instill user and partner trust in Stripe while enabling business growth.

What you’ll do

As a member of the User Risk Strategy team, you will partner with cross-functional teams—including Risk, Product, Partnerships, Legal, Sales, and Data Science—to design and execute on strategies and projects to improve Stripe’s risk controls and user experience. You will provide expert guidance and analyses to the business and to our most strategic customers to enable Stripe to grow in a risk-conscious manner.

</li></ul>Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

<strong>Minimum Requirements

</strong><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience, preferably in Financial Services, Payments or fintech industries</li><li>Experience in a related role (risk, compliance and/or product enablement)</li><li>Experience in developing risk strategies and solutions and working with technical (product and engineering) and operations teams to implement them</li><li>Ability to distill complex, ambiguous risk and policy problems into clear, concise, and reliable guidance for internal stakeholders and Stripe users</li><li>Strong stakeholder management skills, including experience influencing product/engineering, sales, data science, and operations teams</li><li>Demonstrated track record of deriving insights from complex or technical problem spaces and evangelizing actionable product recommendations</li><li>The ability to take ownership, be accountable, and drive towards ambitious goals</li><li>Entrepreneurial and curious mindset, strong communication and interpersonal skills</li><li>Ability to operate independently, navigate ambiguity, and solve problems with the end user in mind</li><li>Strong desire to work in a fast paced and innovative environment

</li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $91,600 - $177,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","Stripe · San Francisco, CA (On-site)","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3832776319/","San Francisco, California, United States","Skills: Business Insights, Stripe (Software), +8 more","1,001-5,000 employees · Technology, Information and Internet
