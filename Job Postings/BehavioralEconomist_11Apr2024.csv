"Economist, Global Media and Entertainment (GME) Science","Description

Amazon’s Global Media and Entertainment (GME) organization is creating a future of entertainment where creative content, innovation, and commerce come together. We leverage Amazon’s unique expertise across video, music, gaming, and more to create a truly immersive entertainment experience. Our team, GME Science, is focused on building science tools to optimize Amazon’s entertainment offerings, so that we can provide a great customer experience while operating as a sustainable and profitable business. We push ourselves to Think Big, building ambitious models that create value in multiple GME businesses.

This role will expand our team’s marketing measurement work. Offsite marketing is a major expense for every GME business, but given business constraints and observational noise, evaluating the impact of a given campaign is challenging. Our team works with measurement teams in each business as well as central measurement teams to build foundational marketing measurement science and adapt it for unique use cases.

Our Team Wrestles With Questions Like

 What’s the ROI of a particular experimental design in marketing, considering the costs of running it and the benefits from validation and calibration? How can we ensure that diverse marketing measurement approaches used across Amazon are truly comparable with one another, for pan-Amazon optimization? How should we understand the costs and benefits of onsite vs. offsite marketing? How much impact does a campaign run by one business have on other Amazon businesses?

To be successful in this role, you will need effective communication, an ability to work closely with stakeholders across our many GME partner teams, and the skill to translate data-driven findings into actionable insights. This includes developing a deep understanding of our business context, which is ambiguous and can change quickly. Your work will be used by decision-makers across GME to deliver the best entertainment experience for our customers, which means we have a high bar. Our healthy team culture is supportive and fast-paced, and we prioritize learning, growth, and helping each other to continuously raise the bar.

Impact and Career Growth

In today’s entertainment landscape, critical decisions are made with data and economic models. You’ll help GME leaders ask the right questions, and then deliver data-driven answers, creating the future of GME at Amazon. You’ll help define a long-term science vision in this space and translate it into an actionable roadmap. This role combines science leadership, organizational ability, technical strength, product focus, and business understanding – a perfect recipe for career growth as an economist in tech.

Key job responsibilities

 Design and build econometric models, especially causal models, to measure the value of the business and its many features Develop science products from concept to prototype to production, incorporating feedback from scientists and business partners Independently identify and pursue new opportunities to leverage economic insights across GME businesses Write business and technical documents communicating business context, methods, and results to business leadership and other scientists Serve as a technical reviewer for our team and related teams, including document and code reviews

"Bloomberg Economics - GeoEconomics - Russia Analyst","With close to 50 economists and 200 economics and government reporters worldwide, Bloomberg has an outstanding capacity to explain where the global economy and geo-politics are now, where they might be heading, and the ways in which the forces interact.

Bloomberg Economics already offers a comprehensive macroeconomic research service for Terminal subscribers. That includes detailed forecasts, supported by thorough and original thematic research.

As a next step, we are adding geoeconomics research, aiming for global coverage of key regions and issues from the Taiwan Strait to the Middle East to the Russia-Ukraine war. The goal is to offer Bloomberg clients a deeper insight into the themes that drive economics, markets, and policy.

We are seeking an expert on Russia, Eastern Europe - including Ukraine - and Central Asia to join our growing team. This person could be based in London or Dubai.

Short-turnaround projects will include quick analysis of breaking news on geo-political events impacting the economy, from the use of tariffs and sanctions to the outbreak of conflict.

Longer-term projects will include taking the lead in building data sets and models that provide a more systematic way of understanding how geo-politics, national politics, and economics in Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia interact, and what that means for markets.

We'll measure success by the breadth and depth of our analysis on this growing area of focus for Bloomberg clients.

WE'LL TRUST YOU TO: 

 Take the lead in building out the teams' knowledge on the intersection of geo-politics, economics, and markets in Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Develop and execute your own ideas for research projects, in addition to supporting collaborative projects. In line with experience, represent the team at client events, on Bloomberg TV and radio, and more broadly. From time to time, work with Bloomberg's economic and government reporters on joint projects.

YOU'LL NEED TO HAVE: 

 8+ years of relevant professional experience and demonstrated expertise in the geo-politics of Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Experience working on questions at the intersection of geopolitics, economic statecraft, the economy and financial markets. A degree in economics, political science, international relations, regional studies or a related field. A graduate degree would be a plus. Strong writing, research, communication and teamwork skills. English proficiency. Energy and the initiative to provide a consistent flow of original, high-quality analysis and to operate in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.

As a next step, we are adding geoeconomics research, aiming for global coverage of key regions and issues from the Taiwan Strait to the Middle East to Latin America. The goal is to offer Bloomberg clients a deeper insight into the themes that drive economics, markets, and policy.

Longer-term projects will include taking the lead in building data sets and models that provide a more systematic way of understanding how geo-politics, national politics, and economics in the Middle East interact, and what that means for markets.

We'll measure success by the breadth and depth of our analysis on this growing area of focus for Bloomberg clients.

WE'LL TRUST YOU TO: 

 Take the lead in building out the teams' knowledge on the intersection of geo-politics, economics, and markets in the Middle East. Develop and execute your own ideas for research projects, in addition to supporting collaborative projects. In line with experience, represent the team at client events, on Bloomberg TV and radio, and more broadly. From time to time, work with Bloomberg's economic and government reporters on joint projects.
