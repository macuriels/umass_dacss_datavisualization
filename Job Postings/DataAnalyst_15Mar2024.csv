"Sr. Data and Insights Analyst","Hey there, we’re Down Home, a new media and entertainment company founded by Tim McGraw and based in Nashville, Tenn. Tim founded Down Home because he recognized that people want more of the type of storytelling you hear in country music. It’s about real life, community, belonging— a focus on the things that matter. We’re creating TV shows, movies, experiences, and products that capture that “Down Home” feeling. And we’re looking for a social media and pop-culture savvy analyst to join our team. 
Our partners in Down Home are the Hollywood studio Skydance Entertainment (Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Jack Ryan) and the LA-based brand consultancy Shareability. As a Down Home analyst, you’ll be working hand-in-hand with Shareability, which leverages the power of social media and influencers to help our brand — as well as clients like Google, YouTube, and Mars — to reach, engage, and activate key audiences. 
This role will be designing analytics across various disciplines and performing marketplace research, resulting in actionable recommendations ranging from social strategy, user behavior trends, brand partnership support, and campaign optimization. Working at Down Home requires a rich and nuanced understanding of the middle American audience; a passion for country culture and country music is a plus. 
The ideal candidate is a naturally curious person and a strong storyteller. For the analyst, BI is not just a series of reports and dashboards— you strive to provide a thoughtful analysis along with a visually impactful report.

Has... ● A Bachelor’s degree (preferably in a business or quantitative field) and 5+ years of relevant professional experience ● Deep understanding of social platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter and beyond ● Experience in a fast-paced digital and/or entertainment environment is a plus ● Strong Excel skills and the ability to manage and analyze large sets of data ● Strong social analytics skills and analysis experience ● 4+ years experience with SQL (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, etc) ● Excellent interpersonal, verbal, and written communication skills both internally and with outside clients ● Experience with survey studies, primary research, and IDIs ● Experience with Social Listening (Infegy, BrandWatch, Talkwalker, or others)
