<strong>The Roku Culture

</strong>Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. 

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

"Senior Data Analyst","Purpose

The Senior Data Analyst will guide AbbVie’s global quality organization by providing process knowledge and statistical expertise to drive data-driven decision making. The incumbent will utilize data science methodology (e.g., machine learning, AI, advanced analytics, etc.) to determine the impact of manufacturing deviations on processes and products, evaluate the impact of process and device changes on quality attributes and customer complaints, and perform trend monitoring of manufacturing and complaint data. The individual will engage in process improvement opportunities that can lead to efficiencies such as product yield improvements, reductions of cycle time, and cost reduction, all within the framework of preserving product quality. The senior data analyst will also drive the approaches and technology used for trend monitoring and data science initiatives in technical and quality areas.

Responsibilities

Identify process improvement opportunities through data science, machine learning, manufacturing site engagement, and applied global supply chain and process knowledge. Quantify potential savings versus costs, prioritize opportunities, and champion implementation.Management experiencePerform root cause analysis in support of complaint and process investigations. Guide teams through DMAIC process, communicate status during project execution, and document results.Author/co-author/review/approve scientific reports and presentations to support and document process deviations/investigations and recommendations for corrective actions, determine impact in product quality, and support regulatory submissions. Report consumers vary but can include quality managers, senior management, internal technical groups, and regulatory agencies.Establish commercial data footprints for commercial and pipeline products. Anticipate potential sources of manufacturing and post market issues based on FMEAs, supply chain variability, and process controls. Ensure critical data is available and linkable across geographically diverse manufacturing networks.Perform ongoing monitoring and baseline activities to ensure that product quality trending complies with internal procedures and regulatory expectations.Manage process performance metrics and actions/alerts generated from trend monitoring systems.Work closely with product performance teams (PPTs) and BTS to build automated reporting systems that efficiently translate raw data into consumable information. Serve as a bridge between these groups to translate business needs into IT language and to help stakeholders leverage emerging information technologies.Provide statistical and software training for relevant personnel across the organization as the need arises to improve awareness and understanding of data analysis offerings and techniques.Create and manage ETL procedures and lead data discovery processes for data model creation and multidimensional models. Manage data model connections for automated data pulls and dashboard updates. Ensure that data models will meet the requirements of analytics and visualization tools to inform business decisions.Create automated dashboards that meet business requirements and deliver value across the organization using data from data models spanning multiple systems and databases.

Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field such as Advanced Analytics, Statistics, Engineering, Operational Research, Computer Science, or Econometrics AND/OR applied science field such as Chemistry, Pharmacy, Chemical Engineering, or Biology. Master’s degree preferred.6+ years’ business experience in business analytics, manufacturing data analytics, data mining, or statistical modeling in a cGMP related industry.
