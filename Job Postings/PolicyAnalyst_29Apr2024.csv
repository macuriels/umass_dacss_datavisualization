The State will target prescription drugs where the pharmaceutical market has failed to lower drug costs, even when a generic or biosimilar medication is available.

Under the direction of the CalRx Program Manager within the Office of Health Care Affordability, the Program Policy Analyst supports CalRx program administration in collaboration with multidisciplinary HCAI offices, including administration, legal, external affairs and communications, and information services.
