About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

Research at Stripe

Stripe’s mission is to increase the GDP of the internet and expand economic access globally. We’re designing tools and infrastructure to help our users start, run, and scale an online business from anywhere in the world. We believe there are too many barriers to doing business on the internet, and that opportunities are not equally distributed throughout the world. We also think building and growing a business online is a problem rooted in code, language, and design—not finance.

That’s where you come in: we’re looking for an early in career Market Researcher to join our growing Stripe Research team to partner with Marketing and design teams to design, lead, and run market research programs that drive insights for the Stripe Brand and Campaign performance.

You will also collaborate with a diverse group of researchers and Stripe’s GTM team from many disciplines, skills, backgrounds, and specialties. We're looking for a researcher with a breadth of methodological “tools”, strong executive presence, and the ability to credibly persuade and influence.

About Stripe Research And The Role

The Stripe Research team is part of Stripe’s Design team and works across many types of brand and product initiatives at Stripe to more effectively and efficiently deliver products and experiences that fulfill user needs. And since Stripe’s main audience is other people who build products, we agonize over and take pride in crafting user-friendly and user-focused experiences.

In addition to conducting primary research, we also enable other Stripes (marketers, sales, engineers, product managers, designers, operations, etc.) to learn and apply research skills to global problems. You will play a role in shaping how we build research as a core competency across Stripe and define how we put users first when conducting research.

As a Market Researcher, you will apply your qualitative and quantitative research skills to build research programs that will inform decisions around customers, products and markets. You will collaborate directly with the Marketing team to translate insights into actions that will drive business impact.

What you'll do

Be an authority on and owner of market research methods and metrics, including brand tracking, campaign awareness, and audience insightsConduct quantitative and qualitative research that deepens our understanding of our users, drives company strategy, and informs internal decision making, messaging, and positioningBuild close partnerships with Marketing and GTM leaders to build the infrastructure for ongoing market research programsWork in a highly collaborative fashion as a strategic partner to Campaign Marketing, Product Marketing, Growth Marketing, and designers to define both the long-term strategy and the short-term tactics for Stripe campaigns Prioritize research needs and approaches across multiple work streams to work on the right project, scale, and scope at the right time and ensure impact by delivering actionable insights Partner closely with other researchers to build out Stripe’s market research practice Source and manage research vendors to help augment the work of the research team.Disseminate research insights to evolve and enhance Stripe’s understanding of user needs and identify innovative opportunities to meet those needs

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.
