Leveraging tens of billions of data points per year, we produce insights that enable WW to better serve our millions of members worldwide.

At WW, the Data Team has a significant seat at the table. We report directly to the CEO and are equal partners with our peers in Product, Engineering, Marketing, Finance, and beyond.
