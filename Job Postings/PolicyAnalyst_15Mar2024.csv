About Us

Climate change is governed by physical facts—about carbon sources, accumulation, impacts, and timing. It’s also caused by economic and political systems that have led to a fossil fuel dependent energy system. These facts must inform strategy: they show that avoiding dangerous climate change is only possible through strong policy to cut carbon, promptly, in the biggest countries.

To address these issues, Energy Innovation was established in 2012 as a clean energy and environmental policy firm to provide timely research and analysis on low-carbon energy policy options to policy makers, thought leaders, and members of the media. The Energy Innovation team has expertise in clean energy, industry, transportation, buildings, technological innovation, and energy policy design. In addition to conducting policy research, Energy Innovation also works with clients to inform philanthropic investments into technology and advocacy that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Energy Innovation supports a hybrid work environment and requires all employees to come together in person two to three times per year.","<strong>REPORTS TO: </strong>Senior Director of Industry
