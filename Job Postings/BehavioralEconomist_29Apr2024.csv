"Graduate Health Economist","Overview / About Us

Lumanity is dedicated to improving patient health by accelerating and optimizing access to medical advances. We partner with life sciences companies around the world to generate evidence to demonstrate the value of their product, translate the science and data into compelling product narratives, and enable commercial decisions that position these products for success in the market. We do this through strategic and complimentary areas of focus: Asset Optimization and Commercialization, Value Access and Outcomes, Medical Strategy and Communications, and Real-World Evidence.

We are seeking a health economist to join our growing and collaborative global health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) team in a hybrid manner in either our Las Vegas or Boston Offices. HEOR is a rapidly developing and increasingly important field due to aging populations and the increasing burden of healthcare. Our HEOR - Modelling and Analytics team works within Lumanity Value Access and Outcomes, which serves our clients by identifying, substantiating, and conveying the value of ground-breaking medical advances. . The tools developed by health economists and statisticians are widely used for evaluating the clinical and economic value of drugs and devices. This process requires economists, statisticians, and clinical writers with a capacity for finding creative solutions to challenging health technology assessment (HTA) problems. Solving such problems necessitates quantitative expertise, as well as an in- depth understanding of the theoretical frameworks employed to assess value in a healthcare setting.

Responsibilities / Position Overview

This is a perfect opportunity for a self-motivated new graduate looking to gain economic modelling experience and learn more about the health economics industry.

The Health Economist will develop economic models to demonstrate the impact of a new health technology (drug, device or diagnostic technique, etc.) on both patients and healthcare systems. This is achieved by modelling their costs and clinical outcomes in relation to existing treatments: The job is varied because every model is bespoke, and your role will depend on your skills and interests, but most projects will require you to:

 Research the disease area and understand the current treatment landscape  Analyse the effectiveness and safety of the new technology using results published in journal articles and patient-level data from clinical trials or disease registries  Use research skills to identify appropriate inputs to inform model variables  Design and develop transparent and user-friendly economic models, these models are typically built in Microsoft Excel®, but the use of other software such as R is becoming more common  Report and explain what you have done - verbally, in a written document, or as a presentation 

In addition to standard modelling work, other responsibilities may include:

 Producing an abstract, poster or manuscript to report the findings of an economic analysis  Developing the economic sections of a health technology assessment reimbursement dossier and commissioning dossiers for a variety of stakeholders  Participating in meetings with fellow team members or clients 

Qualifications

 Minimum expected 2:1/3.7 GPA in any relevant undergraduate degree  A willingness and aptitude to learn  Excellent numerical skills and critical thinking with the ability to clearly and simply explain complex calculations and ideas, both verbally and in writing  Written English to a professional scientific-writing standard  Excellent communication skills and an ease in liaising with technical and non-technical audiences  Fluency in Microsoft Office packages ® , particularly Excel (Visual Basic for Applications and other logic-based software coding knowledge is valuable but not essential at entry)  Ability to work productively in a multidisciplinary team environment  Organisational skills with close attention to detail and personal time management 

Benefits

We offer our employees a comprehensive benefits package that focuses on what matters to you – health and well-being, personal finances, professional development, and a healthy work/life balance:

 Competitive salary plus bonus scheme  Medical, dental, and vision insurance options  401(k) plan with employer match  Flexible paid time off program + 10 paid holidays  Flexible spending accounts for health and dependent care  Health savings account option with employer contribution  Employee Assistance Program  Paid short-term and long-term disability coverage  Company-paid life insurance coverage at 1.5x annual salary  Paid parental leave and more  

Employees can expect to be paid a salary between $55,000-$75,000. The salary range is merely an estimate and may vary based on an applicant’s location, skills, prior experience, professional qualifications, and other relevant factors.
