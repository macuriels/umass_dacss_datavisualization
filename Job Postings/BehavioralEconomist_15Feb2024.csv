"Principal Global Economist","Introduction 

Founded in 1843 , The Economist Group is a global media and information service company that champions progress. With customers spread across 159 countries, The Economist currently has 1.2 million subscribers across print and digital. Headquartered in London, UK, The Economist Group has offices worldwide including other regions in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Americas and Asia. We provide individuals and organizations with the expertise, insights and perspective to press forward. The Economist is the leading source of analysis on international business and world affairs. It delivers information through a range of formats including its newspapers, website, podcasts, and app as well as its conferences and events. What ties it together is the objectivity of its opinion, the originality of our insight and our advocacy of economic and political freedom around the world.

As the research and analysis division of The Economist Group (TEG), EIU helps leaders prepare for opportunity, empowering them to act with confidence when making strategic decisions. EIU is the global standard in providing quality, actionable intelligence to the public and private sector, assessing issues that impact the marketplace for over two hundred countries.

The Country Analysis division of EIU is seeking to recruit a Principal Global Economist. For this senior role, we are looking for an intellectual leader who can lead a team of analysts and collaborate with those from other teams to generate insightful, market-leading content on the US/North America and help drive our view on the global economy and politics. They will be expected to promote and present our views to improve EIU’s visibility among current and prospective clients, address media outlets and participate in client facing events, and be credible as a leading voice in internal discussions. The role requires a thorough understanding of major global themes in economics and policy, and the ability to practically apply research and analysis to real world situations.

The Principal Global Economist will have strong leadership skills and be able to effectively develop and guide a team. They will need to demonstrate economic and forecasting skills, and be able to convey their knowledge and insight to help drive innovation and forecast quality among the team, including among peers.
