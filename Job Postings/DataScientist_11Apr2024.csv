"Senior Data Scientist, GTM Analytics","Overview

Working at Atlassian

Atlassians can choose where they work – whether in an office, from home, or a combination of the two. That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

This is a remote position. To help our teams work together effectively, this role requires you to be located in the United States.

Your Future Team

You will be part of a world-class Data Science team that leverages data to drive insights about our products and customers. The Data Science team partners with Product Managers/Researchers/Data Engineers/Marketers/Privacy and Executive teams to drive and influence. They use a variety of analysis and data-science techniques to understand how Atlassian’s customers engage with our products and communications and, in doing so, identify, design, and measure the success of product investments.

Compensation

At Atlassian, we strive to design equitable, explainable, and competitive compensation programs. To support this goal, the baseline of our range is higher than that of the typical market range, but in turn we expect to hire most candidates near this baseline. Base pay within the range is ultimately determined by a candidate's skills, expertise, or experience. In the United States, we have three geographic pay zones. For this role, our current base pay ranges for new hires in each zone are:

Zone A: $175,100 - $233,400

Zone B: $157,600 - $210,100

Zone C: $145,300 - $193,800

This role may also be eligible for benefits, bonuses, commissions, and equity.
