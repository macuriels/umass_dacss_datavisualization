- Conduct literature searches and reviews
- Create research implements (surveys, experiments, qualitative guides)
- Analyze data
- Assist with the design and content of client deliverables
- Source “real/in-market” examples of BeSci principles for project specific topics
- Ability to translate academic theories into client friendly recommendations

This might be the job for you if you have:
- Strong passion for Behavioral Science, problem solving, and a desire to understand and apply how patients, physicians, and providers make healthcare decisions
- An understanding of behavioral health theories and frameworks and an ability to apply a scientific lens to understanding patient, physician, and insurer motivations and decisions
- Some experience in market research, ideally working with clients
- Demonstrated track-record of excellence in previous work (academic, professional, or personal)
- Advanced degree in psychology, marketing, anthropology, public health, or behavioral science (PhD preferred)
- Comfort using statistical software (Excel, SPSS, STATA, R, etc.) to perform data analysis and create data visualizations
- Professional experience in marketing, insights, applying interventions, or consulting is a plus
- Ability to manage multiple projects and meet deadlines
- Positive attitude and can-do spirit; willingness to challenge conventional thinking
- Works well with others in a close-team environment – open to providing and receiving feedback
- Excellent oral and written communication skills (i.e., emails, PowerPoint, meetings, presentations, etc.)
- Design skills a plus
If you don’t meet 100% of the requirements, we encourage all who feel they might be a fit for the opportunity to apply. We may consider a variety of backgrounds for a particular role and are also committed to considering candidates for available positions throughout our organization, not just the one you’re applying to!
In accordance with NY/CO/CA/WA law, the estimated base salary range for this role is $145,000 to $155,000. Your final base salary will be determined based on several non-discriminatory factors which may include but are not limited to location, work experience, skills, knowledge, education and/or certifications.
