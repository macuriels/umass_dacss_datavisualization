"Data Scientist, Lifecycle Marketing","Grammarly is excited to offer a remote-first hybrid working model. Team members work primarily remotely in the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Germany, or Poland. Certain roles have specific location requirements to facilitate collaboration at a particular Grammarly hub.

All roles have an in-person component: Conditions permitting, teams meet 2–4 weeks every quarter at one of Grammarly’s hubs in San Francisco, Kyiv, New York, Vancouver, and Berlin, or in a workspace in Kraków. This flexible approach gives team members the best of both worlds: plenty of focus time along with in-person collaboration that fosters trust and unlocks creativity.

Grammarly team members in this role must be based in the United States or Canada, and they must be able to collaborate in person 3 weeks per quarter, traveling if necessary to the hub(s) where the team is based.

The opportunity 

Grammarly is the world’s leading AI writing assistance company trusted by over 30 million people and 70,000 professional teams every day. From instantly creating a first draft to perfecting every message, Grammarly’s product offerings help people at 96% of the Fortune 500 get their point across—and get results. Grammarly has been profitable for over a decade because we’ve stayed true to our values and built an enterprise-grade product that’s secure, reliable, and helps people do their best work—without selling their data. We’re proud to be one of Inc.’s best workplaces, a Glassdoor Best Place to Work, one of TIME’s 100 Most Influential Companies, and one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies in AI.

To achieve our ambitious goals, we’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our Data Team. This candidate will partner closely with our B2B Lifecycle Marketing and Demand Generation teams to improve the user lifecycle and lead pipeline through advanced analytics and machine learning. The ideal candidate will have a strong track record of delivering impactful analytical projects within the Growth, Lifecycle Marketing, and Demand Generation domains and partnering with cross-functional peers to guide and influence decision-making.

The Grammarly Data teams are trusted subject matter experts who uncover new insights to inform marketing, product, and growth strategies that drive outcomes at the highest levels of the company. We have large datasets and are looking for folks with deep technical and analytical skills who can break down complex business problems and provide solutions with high visibility and impact for the company.

Grammarly’s engineers and researchers have the freedom to innovate and uncover breakthroughs—and, in turn, influence our product roadmap. The complexity of our technical challenges is growing rapidly as we scale our interfaces, algorithms, and infrastructure. You can hear more from our team on our technical blog.
