</li></ul>Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $121,800 - $220,300. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","Stripe · Chicago, IL","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3840850458/","Chicago, Illinois, United States","6 of 10 skills match your profile - you may be a good fit","1,001-5,000 employees · Technology, Information and Internet

About SpateAt Spate, we use data science to predict the next big consumer trend in beauty, personal care & food.Spate was founded in 2018 by Yarden Horwitz & Olivier Zimmer, two ex-Googlers who led the trendspotting division at Google and uncovered trends such as turmeric, cold brew, and face masks. Spate has been funded by the prestigious Y Combinator incubator and Initialized Capital. We currently have ~180 clients in the U.S., mainly in the beauty space from direct-to-consumer brands to big names such as L’Oréal, Estée Lauder, Unilever. As two ex-Googlers with a passion for using data to spot new patterns in consumer behavior, and we have made it our mission to build the world’s greatest consumer trends prediction platform of all time. And not just because we want to be trendy, but because we want to help brands get better at giving consumers what they really want. Brands waste over $200BN every year due to product launch failures and inventory waste. By spotting Turmeric, we were able to tell brands to stop wasting money on kale products and provide consumers with glorious golden milk lattes instead - because that’s what consumers want.How do we do this? We tap into publicly available consumer data (anonymous and aggregated) to identify interesting shifts in consumer behavior. We leverage the latest available technology in ML to solve problems in ways that have never been explored before.Why Spate?Join a well-funded company that is working with the top brands in consumer goodsWork directly with the founders to set the direction of the companyGrow in a fast-paced environmentAlways be up-to-date on the latest trends!
