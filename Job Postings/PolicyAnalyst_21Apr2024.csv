 To meet responsibilities to oversee Reserve Banks’ provision of currency and coin, BICO staff work closely with the Reserve Bank cash offices to collectively identify and manage risks.

Additional duties of BICO staff include meeting responsibilities to issue notes. BICO staff determine the Board’s annual order for new currency and manage the Board’s annual new currency budget.

Additionally, BICO staff may conduct research on the evolving use of and demand for cash and the payments landscape to understand how they may affect the demand for cash, and emerging trends that may affect the quality of currency in circulation. The analyst hired for this position may contribute to these duties but will not be part of their primary responsibilities.
