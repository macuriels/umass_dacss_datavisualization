"Economist, Global Media and Entertainment (GME) Science","Description

Amazon’s Global Media and Entertainment (GME) organization is creating a future of entertainment where creative content, innovation, and commerce come together. We leverage Amazon’s unique expertise across video, music, gaming, and more to create a truly immersive entertainment experience. Our team, GME Science, is focused on building science tools to optimize Amazon’s entertainment offerings, so that we can provide a great customer experience while operating as a sustainable and profitable business. We push ourselves to Think Big, building ambitious models that create value in multiple GME businesses.

This role will expand our team’s marketing measurement work. Offsite marketing is a major expense for every GME business, but given business constraints and observational noise, evaluating the impact of a given campaign is challenging. Our team works with measurement teams in each business as well as central measurement teams to build foundational marketing measurement science and adapt it for unique use cases.

Our Team Wrestles With Questions Like

 What’s the ROI of a particular experimental design in marketing, considering the costs of running it and the benefits from validation and calibration? How can we ensure that diverse marketing measurement approaches used across Amazon are truly comparable with one another, for pan-Amazon optimization? How should we understand the costs and benefits of onsite vs. offsite marketing? How much impact does a campaign run by one business have on other Amazon businesses?

To be successful in this role, you will need effective communication, an ability to work closely with stakeholders across our many GME partner teams, and the skill to translate data-driven findings into actionable insights. This includes developing a deep understanding of our business context, which is ambiguous and can change quickly. Your work will be used by decision-makers across GME to deliver the best entertainment experience for our customers, which means we have a high bar. Our healthy team culture is supportive and fast-paced, and we prioritize learning, growth, and helping each other to continuously raise the bar.

Impact and Career Growth

In today’s entertainment landscape, critical decisions are made with data and economic models. You’ll help GME leaders ask the right questions, and then deliver data-driven answers, creating the future of GME at Amazon. You’ll help define a long-term science vision in this space and translate it into an actionable roadmap. This role combines science leadership, organizational ability, technical strength, product focus, and business understanding – a perfect recipe for career growth as an economist in tech.

Key job responsibilities

 Design and build econometric models, especially causal models, to measure the value of the business and its many features Develop science products from concept to prototype to production, incorporating feedback from scientists and business partners Independently identify and pursue new opportunities to leverage economic insights across GME businesses Write business and technical documents communicating business context, methods, and results to business leadership and other scientists Serve as a technical reviewer for our team and related teams, including document and code reviews

"Economist, Global Media and Entertainment (GME) Science","This inclusive employer is a member of myGwork – the largest global platform for the LGBTQ+ business community.  

Description

Amazon's Global Media and Entertainment (GME) organization is creating a future of entertainment where creative content, innovation, and commerce come together. We leverage Amazon's unique expertise across video, music, gaming, and more to create a truly immersive entertainment experience. Our team, GME Science, is focused on building science tools to optimize Amazon's entertainment offerings, so that we can provide a great customer experience while operating as a sustainable and profitable business. We push ourselves to Think Big, building ambitious models that create value in multiple GME businesses.

This role will expand our team's marketing measurement work. Offsite marketing is a major expense for every GME business, but given business constraints and observational noise, evaluating the impact of a given campaign is challenging. Our team works with measurement teams in each business as well as central measurement teams to build foundational marketing measurement science and adapt it for unique use cases.

Our Team Wrestles With Questions Like

 What's the ROI of a particular experimental design in marketing, considering the costs of running it and the benefits from validation and calibration? How can we ensure that diverse marketing measurement approaches used across Amazon are truly comparable with one another, for pan-Amazon optimization? How should we understand the costs and benefits of onsite vs. offsite marketing? How much impact does a campaign run by one business have on other Amazon businesses?

To be successful in this role, you will need effective communication, an ability to work closely with stakeholders across our many GME partner teams, and the skill to translate data-driven findings into actionable insights. This includes developing a deep understanding of our business context, which is ambiguous and can change quickly. Your work will be used by decision-makers across GME to deliver the best entertainment experience for our customers, which means we have a high bar. Our healthy team culture is supportive and fast-paced, and we prioritize learning, growth, and helping each other to continuously raise the bar.

Impact and Career Growth

In today's entertainment landscape, critical decisions are made with data and economic models. You'll help GME leaders ask the right questions, and then deliver data-driven answers, creating the future of GME at Amazon. You'll help define a long-term science vision in this space and translate it into an actionable roadmap. This role combines science leadership, organizational ability, technical strength, product focus, and business understanding - a perfect recipe for career growth as an economist in tech.

Key job responsibilities

 Design and build econometric models, especially causal models, to measure the value of the business and its many features Develop science products from concept to prototype to production, incorporating feedback from scientists and business partners Independently identify and pursue new opportunities to leverage economic insights across GME businesses Write business and technical documents communicating business context, methods, and results to business leadership and other scientists Serve as a technical reviewer for our team and related teams, including document and code reviews
