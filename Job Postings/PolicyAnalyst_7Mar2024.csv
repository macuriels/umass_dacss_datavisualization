The Opportunity 

The Center on Education Data and Policy (EDP) undertakes policy-relevant research on issues from prekindergarten through postsecondary education and creates tools such as Urban’s Education Data Portal. We believe that education policy informed by hard data and rigorous research rather than personal experience and ideology is crucial to realizing the education system’s potential to increase socioeconomic mobility and address growing inequality.

A core part of EDP’s strategy is democratizing data for a range of stakeholders working to improve outcomes for students. The Education Data Portal, built in collaboration with Urban’s data science and communications teams, brings all major national datasets on schools, districts, and colleges under one roof, standardizing the information so it is easy to access data, measure change over time, and make connections across datasets.

The Center on Education Data and Policy is seeking an experienced data analyst to work on the Education Data Portal and other projects that involve complex data manipulation and management.

What You’ll Do:

The successful candidate will spend most of their time organizing and cleaning education datasets for inclusion in the Education Data Portal, including the following types of tasks:

Standardize variable definitions to create panel datasets on schools, school districts, and colleges. Manipulate data into the format required by the Portal. Write computer programs to efficiently clean and update education datasets. Review data and code for accuracy. Write documentation and create metadata for education datasets. Collaborate with Urban’s Technology & Data Science and Communications teams to ensure that data and metadata are accurately uploaded to the Portal. Help manage the data update process and provide input on the future direction of the Portal, including the development of new tools. Serve as a resource to other staff on education data sources and programming questions. 

The successful candidate will also contribute to data cleaning and data analysis tasks on other education policy research projects, such as preparing complex student-level datasets for analysis, conducting analyses, and reporting on findings. Data analysis and reporting may be a component of some projects, but this role is focused on understanding, manipulating, and managing education datasets.

Who You Are:

We are looking for an experienced data analyst who is passionate about working with education data. The successful candidate will have:

Completed a master’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g. economics, statistics, computer science, data science, or any quantitative social science) and at least one year of experience working closely with data, or have an equivalent level of experience and education (e.g., a bachelor’s degree with at least three years of experience working with data). Experience working with complex databases, including programming in Stata, R, or other languages. Experience working on education policy research projects. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills. An ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously to successful completion. Strong attention to detail. Comfort working independently and as part of a team. Basic knowledge of education policy in the U.S. (specific knowledge of education datasets is a plus). A demonstrated interest in education policy and share Urban’s belief that “power through knowledge” can help all people thrive in a fast-changing world. 

What you’ll experience:

No matter your role with Urban, you will contribute to meaningful work that makes a difference for people and communities across the country. We are committed to cultivating a community and working in a manner defined by collaboration, equity, inclusivity, independence, and integrity.

Urban’s greatest asset is our people.

</strong>Policy Analyst

<strong>The Opportunity: 

</strong>The right mixture of great ideas and policy can create change. In a complex organization, allocating funding to where it can be most effective can be challenging. That’s why we need you, a financial analyst who can learn to navigate the requirements, policies, and regulations that govern funding to make sure critical efforts aligned to Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E), and other Research and Development (R&D)-related analytical services are appropriately resourced to achieve our client’s mission requirements and make the greatest impact supporting National Security.

As a policy analyst on our team, you’ll study the creation of a policy management strategy to help enhance the ability of Industrial Base Policy (IBP) to strengthen and maintain a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) that is able to meet warfighter’s needs. You’ll help the team develop policy for the client by bringing in-depth understanding and expertise to one or more aspects of service or joint missions, processes, and culture. You will analyze laws and executive orders and DoD directives, instructions, and decisions to determine the impact on U.S. military programs and efforts.

You’ll bring in-depth understanding and expertise to one or more aspects of service or joint missions, processes, and culture. You’ll apply advanced consulting skills and extensive technical expertise, including full industry knowledge. You’ll develop innovative solutions to complex problems, work without considerable direction, and mentor and supervise team members.

You’ll assist a team using laws, regulations, and policies to help the client develop well-formed requirements. Once the funding is in place, you’ll make sure the funding is used efficiently through consistent tracking and communication with project and government leadership. This is your chance to establish skills supporting key DoD initiatives while taking the opportunity to gain financial analysis experience. Work with us as we help fuel innovation to support modernization of our nation’s DIB.
