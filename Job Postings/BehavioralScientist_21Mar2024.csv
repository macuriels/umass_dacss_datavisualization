"Manager, Data Science, Analytics - New Verticals Consumer Shopping Experience","About The Team

DoorDash aims to connect and empower local communities and we’re going beyond food delivery to do so. On New Verticals, we are broadening our selection to grocery, convenience, retail, and more. Our mission is to enable an increasing number of consumer use cases - whether it’s to order a meal, stock up on groceries, or shop from retail stores. The New Verticals consumer team operates across awareness, pricing, shopping experience, and category-specific use cases to drive discovery, adoption, and sustained engagement.

Your team will be partnering closely with product teams; collectively, you will ensure that we offer consumers a delightful, personalized shopping experience that is better than what they would encounter in store. To do so, you’ll work with your team to drive strategic insights and inform product direction, offer technical leadership and build processes to support velocity, and partner with data and product engineers to build robust data foundations.

About DoorDash

At DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods.

DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.

Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at DoorDash. We value a diverse workforce – people who identify as women, non-binary or gender non-conforming, LGBTQIA+, American Indian or Native Alaskan, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, differently-abled, caretakers and parents, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Thank you to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.
