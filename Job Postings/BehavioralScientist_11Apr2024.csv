"User Research Manager","About Us

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge.

Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches
