Conduct analyses using multimodal real-world data (RWD) sources such as electronic health records, medical imaging, and multi-omics to explore opportunities for modeling.

Communicate findings to internal and external stakeholders, as well as the broader community through blogposts and publications in reputable academic venues Contribute to an evolving team with a growth mindset, creating clarity and influencing the team direction. Propose novel approaches for unsolved research problems.
